# API Design Document

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Overview of the Project
Nigeria's recent approval of genetically modified (GM) crops has sparked discussions around food security, sustainability, and environmental impact. Eco-Agric, a leading agricultural software company, recognizes the need for a comprehensive solution that addresses these concerns. We are embarking on a new software development sprint to introduce a feature that caters to the needs of our stakeholders, particularly the farmers who grow organic crops.

The new feature will provide farmers with access to a marketplace for their organic produce. Farmers verified to sell non-GMO produce can list their items with a verified or certified badge after certification. While all farmers can list their produce, only those who pass an authentication process will receive an Organic Produce badge.

### 1.2 Purpose of the API Design Document
The purpose of this document is to outline the architecture, endpoints, and protocols of the API that will support the marketplace feature. It serves as a blueprint for developers to understand and implement the required functionalities.

### 1.3 Scope and Objectives
The scope of this API includes the management of farmer profiles, produce listings, and the certification process. The objectives are to provide a seamless user experience, ensure data integrity, and maintain high security and performance standards.

## 2. System Overview
Eco-Agric's existing system offers a suite of features designed to support agricultural activities and decision-making. The new feature, a marketplace for organic produce, will integrate seamlessly with the current system, providing a dedicated platform for farmers to connect with consumers and sell their organic and non-GMO crops.

## 3. API Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- **API Endpoints**:
  - Farmer registration, authentication, and profile management.
  - Listing, updating, and deleting produce.
  - Authentication process for verifying farmers' organic certification.
  - Browsing and purchasing produce.
  - Obtaining badges for verified/certified farmers.

### Non-functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: The API must handle a growing number of users and transactions efficiently.
- **Security**: Robust measures to protect API endpoints and data from unauthorized access.
- **Performance**: Fast response times and efficient data processing.

## 4. API Design
### RESTful Principles
- **Resource-based Endpoints**: Organized around resources like /farmers, /produce, etc.
- **CRUD Operations**: Support for Create, Read, Update, Delete operations on resources.
- **Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

### Endpoint Documentation
#### Farmer Registration
- **Endpoint URL**: `/api/farmers/register`
- **HTTP Method**: POST
- **Payload**: `{ "name": "string", "email": "string", "password": "string", "location": "string" }`
- **Success Response**: `201 Created`
- **Error Response**: `400 Bad Request`

#### Produce Listing
- **Endpoint URL**: `/api/produce`
- **HTTP Method**: GET
- **Query Parameters**: `?farmer_id=int&certified=bool`
- **Success Response**: `200 OK`
- **Error Response**: `404 Not Found`

#### Update Produce
- **Endpoint URL**: `/api/produce/{produce_id}`
- **HTTP Method**: PUT
- **Payload**: `{ "name": "string", "description": "string", "price": "number", "quantity": "int" }`
- **Success Response**: `200 OK`
- **Error Response**: `400 Bad Request`

#### Delete Produce
- **Endpoint URL**: `/api/produce/{produce_id}`
- **HTTP Method**: DELETE
- **Success Response**: `204 No Content`
- **Error Response**: `404 Not Found`

#### Farmer Authentication
- **Endpoint URL**: `/api/farmers/authenticate`
- **HTTP Method**: POST
- **Payload**: `{ "email": "string", "password": "string" }`
- **Success Response**: `200 OK`
- **Error Response**: `401 Unauthorized`

(Continue documenting other endpoints following the same structure.)

## 5. Security Protocols
- **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: All API communication must be encrypted using TLS.
- **Authentication Tokens**: JWTs are used for secure authentication and authorization.
- **Data Sanitization**: Inputs are sanitized to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.

## 6. Performance Strategies
- **Caching**: Implement caching to store and quickly retrieve frequently accessed data.
- **Database Indexing**: Use indexing to improve the speed of data retrieval operations.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and reliability.

## 7. Error Handling
Proper error handling is crucial for a good user experience. Here's how we'll handle errors in the API:

### Standard Error Response Format
All errors will return a JSON object with a consistent structure to make it easier for clients to parse:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ErrorCode",
    "message": "A description of the error."
  }
}
```
### Differentiating Between Client-side and Server-side Errors
- **Client-side Errors (4xx status codes):** These occur when the client sends a request that the server cannot process.
 - **400 Bad Request:** The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.
- **401 Unauthorized:** The client must authenticate itself to get the requested response.
- **403 Forbidden:** The client does not have access rights to the content.
- **404 Not Found:** The server can not find the requested resource.
- **Server-side Errors (5xx status codes):** These indicate that the server failed to fulfill a valid request.
- **500 Internal Server Error:** A generic error message when an unexpected condition was encountered.
- **503 Service Unavailable:** The server is not ready to handle the request, often due to maintenance or overload.

### Handling Authentication and Authorization Errors
- **Authentication Errors:** When a user fails to provide valid credentials, a 401 Unauthorized status code will be returned.
- **Authorization Errors:** If a user is authenticated but not permitted to perform a requested action, a 403 Forbidden status code will be returned.

## 8. Testing Plan
A comprehensive testing plan ensures that the API functions correctly and efficiently. Hereâ€™s the outline of our testing strategy:

### Test Scenarios for Each API Endpoint
For each endpoint, define test cases that cover:

- Successful requests.
- Requests with invalid input.
- Requests with insufficient permissions.

### Steps for Setting Up Test Environments
- **Local Environment:** Set up a local development environment that mirrors the production setup.
- **Staging Environment:** Deploy the API to a staging environment that closely replicates the production environment.

### Expected Results and Validation Criteria
For each test case, specify:

* The expected HTTP status code.
* The expected response body.
* Any side effects on the database or system state.
By following this testing plan, we can ensure that the API behaves as expected under various conditions and that any errors are handled gracefully and informatively.

## 9. Conclusion
This API design document provides a comprehensive guide for developing the backend services required for Eco-Agric's marketplace feature. It outlines the necessary endpoints, security protocols, and performance strategies to create a robust and efficient system.

### Future Considerations
- **API Versioning**: Implement versioning to manage changes and maintain backward compatibility.
- **Monitoring and Analytics**: Integrate monitoring tools to track API usage and performance.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update the API based on user feedback and technological advancements.
