# API Design Document

## 1. Introduction
- Brief overview of the project.
- Purpose of the API design document.
- Scope and objectives.

## 2. System Overview
- Description of Eco-Agric and its existing features.
- Explanation of the new feature to be added (marketplace for organic produce).

## 3. API Requirements
### Functional Requirements:
- API endpoints for farmer registration, authentication, and profile management.
- Endpoints for listing, updating, and deleting produce.
- Authentication process for verifying farmers' organic certification.
- Endpoints for browsing and purchasing produce.
- Endpoints for obtaining badges for verified/certified farmers.
### Non-functional Requirements:
- Scalability to handle a growing number of users and transactions.
- Security measures to protect API endpoints and data.
- Performance considerations for fast response times.

## 4. API Design
### RESTful Principles:
- Resource-based endpoints (e.g., /farmers, /produce)
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for relevant resources.
- Authentication using tokens (e.g., JWT).
### Endpoint Documentation:
- Endpoint URL
- HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Request parameters
- Response format (JSON, XML)
- Status codes and error handling

## 5. Authentication and Authorization
- Explanation of the authentication process.
- Authorization mechanisms for accessing protected endpoints.
- Role-based access control (e.g., farmer, buyer, admin).

## 6. API Security
- Encryption for sensitive data transmission (HTTPS).
- Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
- Regular security audits and updates.

## 7. Error Handling
- Standard error response format (e.g., {"error": "message"}).
- Differentiating between client-side and server-side errors.
- Handling authentication and authorization errors.

## 8. Performance Considerations
- Caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
- Optimizing database queries and API response times.
- Load balancing and horizontal scaling for high traffic.

## 9. Testing Plan
- Test scenarios for each API endpoint.
- Steps for setting up test environments.
- Expected results and validation criteria.

## 10. Conclusion
- Summary of the API design document.
- Future considerations and enhancements.
