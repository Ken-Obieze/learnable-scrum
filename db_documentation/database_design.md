# Database Design Document

## 1. Introduction
- Brief overview of the project.
- Purpose of the database design document.
- Scope and objectives.

## 2. System Overview
- Description of Eco-Agric and its existing features.
- Explanation of the new feature to be added (marketplace for organic produce).

## 3. Requirements Analysis
### Functional Requirements:
- Entities: Farmer, Produce, Certification
- Relationships: Farmer-Produces (one-to-many), Farmer-Certification (one-to-one)
### Non-functional Requirements:
- Scalability to handle a growing number of users and listings.
- Security measures to protect user data and transactions.
- Performance considerations for fast response times.

## 4. Database Design
### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):
- Farmer: farmer_id, name, email, password, location, etc.
- Produce: produce_id, farmer_id (foreign key), name, description, price, quantity, etc.
- Certification: certification_id, farmer_id (foreign key), certification_type, issue_date, expiration_date, etc.

## 5. Data Dictionary
- Detailed explanation of each table and its attributes.
- Data types, constraints, and descriptions.

## 6. Database Implementation
- Database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- SQL scripts for creating tables, constraints, and relationships.
- Sample data for testing.

## 7. Security Measures
- Encryption for sensitive data (e.g., passwords).
- Access control mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access.
- Regular security audits and updates.

## 8. Performance Considerations
- Indexing for faster query performance.
- Caching mechanisms to reduce database load.
- Optimization techniques for efficient data retrieval.

## 9. Testing Plan
- Test scenarios for each requirement.
- Steps for setting up test environments.
- Expected results and validation criteria.

## 10. Conclusion
- Summary of the database design document.
- Future considerations and enhancements.
